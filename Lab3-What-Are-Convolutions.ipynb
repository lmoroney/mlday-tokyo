First, of course, it's not 28x28 greyscale, but more importantly, the classifier was trained on the raw pixels of a left-facing boot, and not the features that make up what a boot is.\n","\n","That's where Convolutions are very powerful. A convolution is a filter that passes over an image, processing it, and extracting features that show a commonolatity in the image.
